# Nebulous.io Clone with Unity3d

In this project, I tried to replicate the basic mechanics of nebulous.io in Unity Engine.
Without multiplayer, but with simple AI and more...

Main part:
- [x] 2D game
- [x] Music
- [x] Main menu
- [x] Nebulous UI

Game part:
- [x] Enemies with simple AI
- [x] Scoreboard
- [x] Skins
  and more...
